        <p>The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected 
        computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] 
        to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks
         that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government
          networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of
           electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 
           The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and 
           services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the
            World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.</p>
